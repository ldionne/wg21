# Introduction

[P2786][] is currently making progress through EWG and LEWG. In Poland, LEWG expressed a strong desire for
that language feature to come with a proper user-facing library interface. This paper proposes such an
interface. That interface is heavily influenced by the uninitialized algorithms that were originally
proposed in [P1144][] which, after implementation experience in libc++, seem to be what's right for the
library.

# Motivation

Today, many algorithms and containers use some flavor of assignment, either as an implementation detail or
as part of their API promise. In cases where the use of assignment is merely an implementation detail, writing
the code in terms of relocation can often result in cleaner code and improved performance (since move-construction
is often faster than move-assignment).

Furthermore, in a future where the language itself provides a definition of relocation (and in particular
trivial relocation), algorithms and containers written in terms of relocation today would benefit from a
massive speedup for trivially relocatable types, without requiring any change.

# Proposal

We propose adding algorithms `std::uninitialized_relocate`, `std::uninitialized_relocate_n`, and
`std::uninitialized_relocate_backward`. We also add the equivalent `ranges::` functions and the
parallel algorithm overloads. At a high level, these algorithms relocate a range of objects from
one memory location to another, which is a very useful primitive when writing containers and algorithms.

However, the library interface proposed here is intentionally independent of the details of the underlying
language feature.

Design points:

- These functions behave similarly to the other uninitialized algorithms like `std::uninitialized_copy`, with
  the difference that the new proposed relocation algorithms support overlapping input/output ranges like
  `std::move` and `std::move_backward`. That is necessary in order to support most use cases where one
  is relocating a range a bit "to the right" or a bit "to the left" of its current location.
- Unlike P2786 which talks of _trivial relocation_, these algorithms talk of _relocation_ in the general
  sense. This is because it's generally more useful (and easier!) to write an algorithm or data structure
  operation in terms of general relocation, even if it is not trivial (in which case it is move + destroy). Even
  non-trivial relocation is usually faster than the equivalent assignment-based algorithm. By encouraging users
  to write their code in terms of general relocation today, we are preparing the terrain for when the language
  gets a notion of trivial relocation, and in the meantime we let implementations optimize under the as-if rule.
- The algorithms provide an exception guarantee that in case of an exception, the whole source range is destroyed
  and the whole destination range as well. Otherwise, the ranges would contain an unknown number of alive objects,
  making it impossible for the caller to perform a clean up. This turns out to work well with what e.g.
  `std::vector::insert` requires in order to provide the basic exception safety guarantee (see the examples below).
- The algorithms accept `input_iterator`s (or `bidirectional_iterator`s for the backward variant) for the input
  range. This iterator category is sufficient to implement these algorithms properly. However, it does mean that
  the range overlap precondition cannot be checked at runtime for some iterator categories. In practice, we would
  expect an implementation that wishes to check this precondition to do so whenever the input range is at least
  random access, which should be the vast majority of use cases.
- The proposed API facilities are intended to be as consistent as possible with existing uninitialized algorithms,
  with the few differences being a direct consequence of the fact that the source range does not contain any
  elements after performing the operation.

# Usage examples

In these examples, we ignore allocator support for simplicity, and we use `iterator` instead of `const_iterator`
as the parameter types to lighten the code. The "real" code for implementing these functions does not look
meaningfully different.

## `vector::emplace` / `vector::insert`

::: cmptable

### Assignment based

```c++
template <class ...Args>
constexpr iterator
vector<T>::emplace(iterator position, Args&&... args) {
  if [[unlikely]] (size() == capacity()) {
    // slow path where we grow the vector
  }

  if (position == end()) {
    std::construct_at(std::to_address(position),
                      std::forward<Args>(args)...);
    ++end_;
  } else {
    T tmp(std::forward<Args>(args)...);

    // Create a gap at the end by moving the last
    // element into the "new last position".
    std::construct_at(std::to_address(end()),
                      std::move(back()));
    ++end_;

    // The element before the last one is moved-from:
    // shift everything else by one position to the
    // right to open a gap at the insert location.
    std::move_backward(position, end() - 2, end() - 1);

    // Now there's a gap at the insert location, move the
    // new element into it.
    *position = std::move(tmp);
  }
  return position;
}
```

### Relocation based

```c++
template <class ...Args>
constexpr iterator
vector<T>::emplace(iterator position, Args&&... args) {
  if [[unlikely]] (size() == capacity()) {
    // slow path where we grow the vector
  }

  if (position == end()) {
    std::construct_at(std::to_address(position),
                      std::forward<Args>(args)...);
    ++end_;
  } else {
    T tmp(std::forward<Args>(args)...);

    // Create a gap inside the vector by relocating
    // everything to the right.
    try {
      std::uninitialized_relocate_backward(position, end(),
                                           end() + 1);
    } catch (...) {
      // basic guarantee: vector lost its tail
      end_ = std::to_address(position);
      throw;
    }

    // Move-construct the new value into the gap created above.
    try {
      std::construct_at(std::to_address(position), std::move(tmp));
    } catch (...) {
      // basic guarantee: vector lost its tail
      std::destroy(position + 1, end() + 1);
      end_ = std::to_address(position);
      throw;
    }

    ++end_;
  }
  return position;
}
```

A few things are worth noting:

- The relocation-based implementation looks more complicated than the assignment-based one, but in reality the
  complexity only stems from exception handling. The algorithm is conceptually simpler because we just relocate
  things around instead of creating artificial gaps that contain moved-from objects, like in the assignment-based
  one.
- Both implementations provide the basic exception safety guarantee, but they provide it differently. After an
  exception, the assignment-based implementation may leave elements in the `[position, end())` range in a moved-from state,
  and the vector size may or may not have been incremented by 1.
  Whether this is actually the case or not depends on which operation exactly throws. Either way, the user has
  no direct means to know which elements have been left in a moved-from state.
  The relocation-based implementation instead ends up with the elements in `[position, end())` being erased from the vector.
  It's unclear whether one behavior is really superior over the other, but both are conforming.
- There is no mention of trivial relocation in the implementation. We relocate elements even when that is not
  equivalent to `std::memcpy` (or whatever the language definition is).
- An implementation that considers the usage of move-assignment to be part of the function's API may want to preserve
  that behavior, in which case the relocating code path may be guarded by something like P2786's `is_replaceable_v<T>`
  (and otherwise fallback to move-assignment). In the absence of `is_replaceable`, a conservative implementation could
  use `std::is_trivially_copyable` as a guard.

Inserting in the middle of a `std::vector<std::string>` is roughly TODOx times faster with relocation
than with assignments.

## `vector::erase`

::: cmptable

### Assignment based

```c++
constexpr iterator
vector<T>::erase(iterator first, iterator last) {
  if (first == last)
    return last;

  auto new_end = std::move(last, end(), first);
  std::destroy(new_end, end());

  end_ -= (last - first);
  return first;
}
```

### Relocation based

```c++
constexpr iterator
vector<T>::erase(iterator first, iterator last) {
  if (first == last)
    return last;

  // Destroy the range being erased and relocate the
  // tail of the vector into the created gap.
  if constexpr (is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T>) {
    std::destroy(first, last);
    std::uninitialized_relocate(last, end(), first);
  } else {
    auto new_end = std::move(last, end(), first);
    std::destroy(new_end, end());
  }

  end_ -= (last - first);
  return first;
}
```

:::

Things worth noting:

- In the case of `vector::erase`, we cannot unconditionally use relocation when it is potentially throwing. This is
  because `vector::erase` is required not to throw an exception unless `T`'s move-assignment operator throws. We view
  this as an overspecification in the Standard that could be relaxed -- this is probably an artifact of the fact that
  implementations were assumed to use assignment.
- There is no mention of trivial relocation above. However, if the language offered one, and if `is_trivially_relocatable`
  were independent from `std::is_nothrow_move_constructible`, we could generalize the `if` statement above by also
  performing relocation when it is trivial, even if the move constructor is potentially throwing.
- Like for `vector::emplace`, an implementation that considers the usage of move-assignment to be part of the function's
  API may want to preserve that behavior by further constraining the usage of relocation.

Erasing in the middle of a `std::vector<std::string>` is roughly TODOx times faster with relocation than with
assignments.

## `vector::emplace_back` / `vector::push_back`

Note that the vector growth policy presented here is more naive than what `std::vector` typically does.

::: cmptable

### Move-construction based

```c++
template <class ...Args>
constexpr reference
vector<T>::emplace_back(Args&& ...args) {
  if [[likely]] (size() < capacity()) {
    std::construct_at(std::to_address(end()),
                      std::forward<Args>(args)...);
    ++end_;
    return back();
  }

  // Move or copy all the elements into a large
  // enough vector.
  vector<T> tmp;
  tmp.reserve((size() + 1) * 2);
  for (auto& element : *this) {
    [[assume(tmp.size() < tmp.capacity())]];
    tmp.emplace_back(std::move_if_noexcept(element));
  }

  [[assume(tmp.size() < tmp.capacity())]];
  tmp.emplace_back(std::forward<Args>(args)...);

  swap(tmp);
  return back();
}
```

### Relocation based

```c++
template <class ...Args>
constexpr reference
vector<T>::emplace_back(Args&& ...args) {
  if [[likely]] (size() < capacity()) {
    std::construct_at(std::to_address(end()),
                      std::forward<Args>(args)...);
    ++end_;
    return back();
  }

  // Relocate all the elements into a large enough vector,
  // or copy if moving is potentially throwing.
  vector<T> tmp;
  tmp.reserve((size() + 1) * 2);
  if constexpr (is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T>) {
    tmp.end_ = std::uninitialized_relocate(begin(), end(), tmp.begin_);
  } else {
    for (auto& element : *this) {
      [[assume(tmp.size() < tmp.capacity())]];
      tmp.emplace_back(element);
    }
  }

  [[assume(tmp.size() < tmp.capacity())]];
  tmp.emplace_back(std::forward<Args>(args)...);

  swap(tmp);
  return back();
}
```

- [?]{.pnum} _Preconditions_: `olast` is not in the range (ifirst, ilast]`.

- [?]{.pnum} _Effects_: Equivalent to:

<!--
TODO.

Need to figure if it's a good idea that these algorithms take ranges and not just a bidirectional iterator as output.
There seems to be some inconsistency: std::ranges::move_backward takes range+single iterator. But std::ranges::uninitialized_copy takes 2 ranges. Which one to follow here?
-->


<!--

If we assume the existence of is_trivially_relocatable, we would also accept ranges like this
in the ranges algorithms:

template <class I, class O>
using is-trivially-relocatable-range = // exposition-only
  same_as<iter_value_t<I>, iter_value_t<O>> &&
  contiguous_iterator<I> && contiguous_iterator<O> &&
  is_trivially_relocatable_v<iter_value_t<I>>;
