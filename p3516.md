# Introduction

[P2786][] is currently making progress through EWG and LEWG. In Poland, LEWG expressed a strong desire for
that language feature to come with a proper user-facing library interface. This paper proposes such an
interface. That interface is heavily influenced by the uninitialized algorithms that were originally
proposed in [P1144][] which, after implementation experience in libc++, seem to be almost exactly what
we need.

This paper aims to provide the high-level algorithms that all programmers will want to use, while purposefully
not touching on some of the more contentious design points of [P2786][]/[P1144][]. The high-level algorithms
proposed in this paper are compatible with essentially any definition of "trivial relocation" we might
introduce in the language in C++26 or later.

# Motivation

Today, many algorithms and containers use some flavor of assignment, either as an implementation detail or
as part of their API promise. In cases where the use of assignment is merely an implementation detail, writing
the code in terms of relocation can often result in cleaner code and improved performance (since move-construction
is often faster than move-assignment).

Furthermore, in a future where the language itself provides a definition of relocation (and in particular
trivial relocation), algorithms and containers written in terms of relocation today would benefit from a
massive speedup for trivially relocatable types without requiring any change. Indeed, the algorithms
introduced in this paper boil down to `memmove` (or `memcpy` if we can prove the absence of overlap) in
trivial cases, which are fairly common.

# Proposal

We propose adding algorithms `std::uninitialized_relocate`, `std::uninitialized_relocate_n`, and
`std::uninitialized_relocate_backward`. We also add the equivalent `ranges::` functions and the
parallel algorithm overloads. At a high level, these algorithms relocate a range of objects from
one memory location to another, which is a very useful primitive when writing containers and algorithms.

However, the library interface proposed here is intentionally independent of the details of the underlying
language feature.

Design points:

- These functions behave similarly to the other uninitialized algorithms like `std::uninitialized_copy`, with
  the difference that the new proposed relocation algorithms support overlapping input/output ranges like
  `std::move` and `std::move_backward`. That is necessary in order to support most use cases where one
  is relocating a range a bit "to the right" or a bit "to the left" of its current location.
- Unlike P2786 which talks of _trivial relocation_, these algorithms talk of _relocation_ in the general
  sense. This is because it's generally more useful (and easier!) to write an algorithm or data structure
  operation in terms of general relocation, even if it is not trivial (in which case it is move + destroy). Even
  non-trivial relocation is usually faster than the equivalent assignment-based algorithm. By encouraging users
  to write their code in terms of general relocation today, we are preparing the terrain for when the language
  gets a notion of trivial relocation, and in the meantime we let implementations optimize under the as-if rule.
- The algorithms provide an exception guarantee that in case of an exception, the whole source range is destroyed
  and the whole destination range as well. Otherwise, the ranges would contain an unknown number of alive objects,
  making it impossible for the caller to perform a clean up. This turns out to work well with what e.g.
  `std::vector::insert` requires in order to provide the basic exception safety guarantee (see the examples below).
- The algorithms accept `input_iterator`s (or `bidirectional_iterator`s for the backward variant) for the input
  range. This iterator category is sufficient to implement these algorithms properly. However, it does mean that
  the range overlap precondition cannot be checked at runtime for some iterator categories. In practice, we would
  expect an implementation that wishes to check this precondition to do so whenever the input range is at least
  random access, which should be the vast majority of use cases.
- The algorithms accept `forward_iterator`s for the output range, which is necessary to perform cleanup if an
  exception is thrown.
- The proposed API facilities are intended to be as consistent as possible with existing uninitialized algorithms,
  with the few differences being a direct consequence of the fact that the source range does not contain any
  elements after performing the operation.

# Usage examples

In these examples, we ignore allocator support for simplicity, and we use `iterator` instead of `const_iterator`
as the parameter types to lighten the code. The "real" code for implementing these functions does not look
meaningfully different.

## `vector::emplace` / `vector::insert`

::: cmptable

### Assignment based

```c++
template <class ...Args>
constexpr iterator
vector<T>::emplace(iterator position, Args&&... args) {
  if [[unlikely]] (size() == capacity()) {
    // slow path where we grow the vector
  }

  if (position == end()) {
    std::construct_at(std::to_address(position),
                      std::forward<Args>(args)...);
    ++end_;
  } else {
    T tmp(std::forward<Args>(args)...);

    // Create a gap at the end by moving the last
    // element into the "new last position".
    std::construct_at(std::to_address(end()),
                      std::move(back()));
    ++end_;

    // The element before the last one is moved-from:
    // shift everything else by one position to the
    // right to open a gap at the insert location.
    std::move_backward(position, end() - 2, end() - 1);

    // Now there's a gap at the insert location, move the
    // new element into it.
    *position = std::move(tmp);
  }
  return position;
}
```

### Relocation based

```c++
template <class ...Args>
constexpr iterator
vector<T>::emplace(iterator position, Args&&... args) {
  if [[unlikely]] (size() == capacity()) {
    // slow path where we grow the vector
  }

  if (position == end()) {
    std::construct_at(std::to_address(position),
                      std::forward<Args>(args)...);
    ++end_;
  } else {
    T tmp(std::forward<Args>(args)...);

    // Create a gap inside the vector by relocating
    // everything to the right.
    try {
      std::uninitialized_relocate_backward(position, end(),
                                           end() + 1);
    } catch (...) {
      // basic guarantee: vector lost its tail
      end_ = std::to_address(position);
      throw;
    }

    // Move-construct the new value into the gap created above.
    try {
      std::construct_at(std::to_address(position), std::move(tmp));
    } catch (...) {
      // basic guarantee: vector lost its tail
      std::destroy(position + 1, end() + 1);
      end_ = std::to_address(position);
      throw;
    }

    ++end_;
  }
  return position;
}
```

:::


A few things are worth noting:

- The relocation-based implementation looks more complicated than the assignment-based one, but in reality the
  complexity only stems from exception handling. The algorithm is conceptually simpler because we just relocate
  things around instead of creating artificial gaps that contain moved-from objects, like in the assignment-based
  one.
- Both implementations provide the basic exception safety guarantee, but they provide it differently. After an
  exception, the assignment-based implementation may leave elements in the `[position, end())` range in a moved-from state,
  and the vector size may or may not have been incremented by 1.
  Whether this is actually the case or not depends on which operation exactly throws. Either way, the user has
  no direct means to know which elements have been left in a moved-from state.
  The relocation-based implementation instead ends up with the elements in `[position, end())` being erased from the vector.
  It's unclear whether one behavior is really superior over the other, but both are conforming.
- There is no mention of _trivial_ relocation in the implementation. We relocate elements even when that is not
  equivalent to `std::memcpy` (or whatever the language definition would be).
- An implementation that considers the usage of move-assignment to be part of the function's API may want to preserve
  that behavior, in which case the relocating code path may be guarded by something like P2786's `is_replaceable_v<T>`
  (and otherwise fallback to move-assignment). In the absence of `is_replaceable`, a conservative implementation could
  use `std::is_trivially_copyable` as a guard.

Inserting in the middle of a `std::vector<std::string>` is roughly X times faster with relocation
than with assignments.

## `vector::erase`

::: cmptable

### Assignment based

```c++
constexpr iterator
vector<T>::erase(iterator first, iterator last) {
  if (first == last)
    return last;

  auto new_end = std::move(last, end(), first);
  std::destroy(new_end, end());

  end_ -= (last - first);
  return first;
}
```

### Relocation based

```c++
constexpr iterator
vector<T>::erase(iterator first, iterator last) {
  if (first == last)
    return last;

  // Destroy the range being erased and relocate the
  // tail of the vector into the created gap.
  std::destroy(first, last);
  std::uninitialized_relocate(last, end(), first);

  end_ -= (last - first);
  return first;
}
```

:::

Things worth noting:

- Again, there is no mention of _trivial_ relocation above, since we write the algorithm in term of general relocation.
- Like for `vector::emplace`, an implementation that considers the usage of move-assignment to be part of the function's
  API may want to preserve that behavior by further constraining the usage of relocation.
- Pedantically, the relocation-based implementation violates an exception constraint on `std::vector::erase`. The current
  specification requires `vector::erase` not to throw an exception unless `T`'s _move-assignment operator_ throws. The
  implementation above can also throw if the _move-constructor_ throws. We view this as an overspecification in the
  Standard that could be relaxed -- this is probably an artifact of the fact that implementations were assumed to use
  assignment. To make the definition above pedantically correct, we should only use relocation when
  `is_nothrow_move_constructible<T>` is satisfied, and otherwise use assignment.

## `vector::emplace_back` / `vector::push_back`

Note that the vector growth policy presented here is more naive than what `std::vector` typically does. Also
keep in mind that we must provide the strong exception safety guarantee here.

::: cmptable

### Move-construction based

```c++
template <class ...Args>
constexpr reference
vector<T>::emplace_back(Args&& ...args) {
  if [[likely]] (size() < capacity()) {
    std::construct_at(std::to_address(end()),
                      std::forward<Args>(args)...);
    ++end_;
    return back();
  }

  // Move or copy all the elements into a large
  // enough vector.
  vector<T> tmp;
  tmp.reserve((size() + 1) * 2);
  for (auto& element : *this) {
    [[assume(tmp.size() < tmp.capacity())]];
    tmp.emplace_back(std::move_if_noexcept(element));
  }

  [[assume(tmp.size() < tmp.capacity())]];
  tmp.emplace_back(std::forward<Args>(args)...);

  swap(tmp);
  return back();
}
```

### Relocation based

```c++
template <class ...Args>
constexpr reference
vector<T>::emplace_back(Args&& ...args) {
  if [[likely]] (size() < capacity()) {
    std::construct_at(std::to_address(end()),
                      std::forward<Args>(args)...);
    ++end_;
    return back();
  }

  // Relocate all the elements into a large enough vector,
  // or copy if moving might throw.
  vector<T> tmp;
  tmp.reserve((size() + 1) * 2);
  if constexpr (is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T>) {
    tmp.end_ = std::uninitialized_relocate(begin(), end(), tmp.begin_);
    end_ = begin_;
  } else {
    for (auto& element : *this) {
      [[assume(tmp.size() < tmp.capacity())]];
      tmp.emplace_back(std::move_if_noexcept(element));
    }
  }

  // At this point, the original contents of the vector are in tmp, which is large enough.
  // Construct the new last element.
  try {
    [[assume(tmp.size() < tmp.capacity())]];
    tmp.emplace_back(std::forward<Args>(args)...);
  } catch (...) {
    swap(tmp);
    throw;
  }

  swap(tmp);
  return back();
}
```

Things worth noting:

- Again, there is no mention of _trivial_ relocation: we write the algorithm based on general relocation.
- The above implementation omits to support the case where `args...` is in fact a single object located inside
  the vector we're inserting in. Supporting that essentially requires creating a temporary value or constructing
  the new element before we start moving from the current vector, but does not meaningfully change the code.
- We use `std::move_if_noexcept` even in the case of a potentially throwing move constructor because we must
  handle non-copyable types with a potentially throwing move constructor (in which case the strong exception
  safety guarantee is waived).

# Compatibility with trivial relocation proposals

If we had trivial relocation in the language, these algorithms would not need to change significantly, assuming that
trivial relocation is equivalent to move + destroy when both are valid. We can't imagine a trivial relocation design
where that wouldn't be the case.

If C++ gets a notion of _trivial_ relocation that increases the expressive power over move + destroy (like [P2786][]),
then these uninitialized algorithms should be slightly generalized to support types that are not movable but that are
still trivially relocatable. Thus, these algorithms would be able to operate either on types that are movable, or on
types that are not movable but trivially relocatable instead. That would be a small backwards compatible change.

### [uninitialized.relocate_backward]

Append to [specialized.algorithms]{.sref} a new subclause, `uninitialized_relocate_backward` [uninitialized.relocate_backward],
with these contents:

```c++
template<class NoThrowBidirectionalIterator1, class NoThrowBidirectionalIterator2>
  constexpr NoThrowBidirectionalIterator2
    uninitialized_relocate_backward(NoThrowBidirectionalIterator1 first,
                                    NoThrowBidirectionalIterator1 last,
                                    NoThrowBidirectionalIterator2 result);
```

- [?]{.pnum} _Preconditions_: `result` is not in the range `(first, last]`.

- [?]{.pnum} _Effects_: Equivalent to:

```c++
NoThrowBidirectionalIterator2 result_last = result;
try {
  while (last != first) {
    --last;
    --result;
    @_relocate-at_@(addressof(*result), addressof(*last));
  }
} catch (...) {
  destroy(first, last);
  destroy(++result, result_last);
  throw;
}

return {last, result};
```

```c++
namespace ranges {
  template<@_nothrow-bidirectional-iterator_@ I, @_nothrow-sentinel-for_@<I> S1,
           @_nothrow-bidirectional-iterator_@ O, @_nothrow-sentinel-for_@<O> S2>
    requires @_relocatable-from_@<iter_value_t<I>, iter_value_t<O>>
      constexpr uninitialized_relocate_backward_result<I, O>
        uninitialized_relocate_backward(I ifirst, S1 ilast, O ofirst, S2 olast);

  template<@_nothrow-bidirectional-range_@ IR, @_nothrow-bidirectional-range_@ OR>
    requires @_relocatable-from_@<range_value_t<IR>, range_value_t<OR>>
      constexpr uninitialized_relocate_backward_result<borrowed_iterator_t<IR>, borrowed_iterator_t<OR>>
        uninitialized_relocate_backward(IR&& in_range, OR&& out_range);
}
```

- [?]{.pnum} _Preconditions_: `olast` is not in the range `(ifirst, ilast]`.

- [?]{.pnum} _Effects_: Equivalent to:

```c++

try {
  while (ilast != ifirst && olast != ofirst) {
    --ilast;
    --olast;
    @_relocate-at_@(addressof(*olast), addressof(*ilast));
  }
} catch (...) {

  destroy(++olast, result_last);
  throw;
}

return {ilast, olast};
```

<!--
TODO.

Need to figure if it's a good idea that these algorithms take ranges and not just a bidirectional iterator as output.
There seems to be some inconsistency: std::ranges::move_backward takes range+single iterator. But std::ranges::uninitialized_copy takes 2 ranges. Which one to follow here?

If we assume the existence of is_trivially_relocatable, we would also accept ranges like this
in the ranges algorithms:

template <class I, class O>
using is-trivially-relocatable-range = // exposition-only
  same_as<iter_value_t<I>, iter_value_t<O>> &&
  contiguous_iterator<I> && contiguous_iterator<O> &&
  is_trivially_relocatable_v<iter_value_t<I>>;
