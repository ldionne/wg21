# Introduction

[P3516][] was design-approved by LEWG in Hagenberg. As part of that discussion, we also discussed cleaning up the
relocation-related APIs provided in the library (since [P2786][] also added some). There was a fair amount of consensus
in the room that the introduction of [P3516][] removed the need for some of the APIs added by [P2786][]. However, we
decided to punt it to a separate paper to allow P3516 to progress. This is the cleanup paper.

# Proposal

The current state of the APIs that have been voted into the draft or design approved in Hagenberg is this:

```c++
// P2786 APIs (in draft)
template <class T>
T* trivially_relocate(T* first, T* last, T* result); // freestanding

template <class T>
constexpr T* relocate(T* first, T* last, T* result); // freestanding

// P3516 APIs (design approved)
template<class T>
 requires @_relocatable-from_@<T, T>
  constexpr T* relocate_at(T* dest, T* source)
    noexcept(is_nothrow_relocatable_v<T>);

template<class NoThrowForwardIterator1, class NoThrowForwardIterator2>
  constexpr NoThrowForwardIterator2
    uninitialized_relocate(NoThrowForwardIterator1 first,
                           NoThrowForwardIterator1 last,
                           NoThrowForwardIterator2 result); // freestanding

template<class NoThrowForwardIterator1, class Size, class NoThrowForwardIterator2>
  constexpr pair<NoThrowForwardIterator1, NoThrowForwardIterator2>
    uninitialized_relocate_n(NoThrowForwardIterator1 first,
                             Size n,
                             NoThrowForwardIterator2 result); // freestanding

template<class NoThrowBidirectionalIterator1, class NoThrowBidirectionalIterator2>
  constexpr NoThrowBidirectionalIterator2
    uninitialized_relocate_backward(NoThrowBidirectionalIterator1 first,
                                    NoThrowBidirectionalIterator1 last,
                                    NoThrowBidirectionalIterator2 result); // freestanding

// ... also std::execution_policy overloads ...

namespace ranges {
  // ... similar overloads here ...
}
```

To clean things up, we propose:

- Removing `std::relocate(...)`. It was introduced before we had proper relocation algorithms, and it's
  basically a less capable version of the uninitialized algorithms above since it doesn't support iterators
  and potentially-throwing move constructors. One difference is that `std::relocate(...)` does detect overlaps
  and decides to relocate forward or backward, which [P3516][] handles by having a `_backward` variant instead
  (which is consistent with existing uninitialized algorithms).
- Making `std::trivially_relocate` an exposition-only helper. We don't want to encourage users to call it, instead they
  should make use of the (safer) algorithms that take iterators and handle exceptions properly. We do not lose any
  functionality, since `std::uninitialized_relocate` is basically equivalent to it for trivially relocatable types
  (modulo the detection of overlap). Note that we need to keep that function as exposition-only because it defines
  important core-language wording for trivial relocation, and [P3516][] uses it. We could potentially make it a
  function working on a single element instead, since that's what [P3516][]'s `std::relocate_at` requires, but we
  are not attached to that.

# Wording changes

## Synopsis of relocation functions 20.2.2 [memory.syn]

Remove `trivially_relocate` and `relocate` from the synopsis:

::: rm
> ```c++
> template <class T>
>   T* trivially_relocate(T* first, T* last, T* result);                        // freestanding
>
> template <class T>
>   constexpr T* relocate(T* first, T* last, T* result);                        // freestanding
> ```
:::

## Definitions for relocation functions (20.2.6 [obj.lifetime])

Make `trivially_relocate` exposition-only. In Explicit lifetime management [obj.lifetime]{.sref}:

```diff
template <class T>
- T* trivially_relocate(T* first, T* last, T* result);
+ T* trivially-relocate(T* first, T* last, T* result);
```

Remove `std::relocate` entirely:

::: rm
> ```c++
> template <class T>
>  constexpr T* relocate(T* first, T* last, T* result);
> ```

_Mandates_: `is_nothrow_relocatable_v<T> && !is_const_v<T>` is `true`. `T` is not an array of unknown bound.

_Preconditions_:

  - `[first, last)` is a valid range.
  - `[result, result + (last - first))` denotes a region of storage that is a subset of the region reachable
    through result (6.8.4 [basic.compound]) and suitably aligned for the type `T`.
  - No element in the range `[first, last)` is a potentially-overlapping subobject.

_Effects_:

  - If `result == first` is `true`, no effect;
  - otherwise, if not called during constant evaluation and `is_trivially_relocatable_v<T>` is `true`, then has
    effects equivalent to: `trivially_relocate(first, last, result);`
  - otherwise, for each integer `i` in `[0, last - first)`,
    - if `T` is an array type, equivalent to: `relocate(begin(first[i]), end(first[i]), *start_lifetime_as<T>(result + i));`
    - otherwise, equivalent to: `construct_at(result + i, std::move(first[i])); destroy_at(first + i);`

_Returns_: `result + (last-first)`.

_Throws_: Nothing.

[Overlapping ranges are supported.]{.note}
